# Online-Connect-Four
These java files allow you to play a game of connect four online using a terminal.

Make sure to put them all into a package using javac -d . filename, as opposed to just javac filename

First, compile board.java, then move on to ConnectFourClient.java and ConnectFourServer.java

To run, use java ConnectFour.ConnectFourClient or java ConnectFour.ConnectFourServer. Make sure that others can access the port you are opening up.
Also, if you are hosting a client on the same server as the host, just use localhost for the address.
If you want to play against an AI, boot up another client and set it as as AI. This is so that you can have two AIs playing against each other.
